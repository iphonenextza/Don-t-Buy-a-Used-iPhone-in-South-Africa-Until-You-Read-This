### Thinking of buying a preowned iPhone? Here’s what you need to know.  
You’re ready to upgrade to an iPhone — but can’t justify paying R20,000+ for a brand-new device or signing a long-term mobile contract. That’s where preowned iPhones come in. But not all refurbished iPhones are created equal.  

In South Africa, it’s easy to get burned by fake iPhones, locked devices, and sellers who disappear after payment.

**At iPhoneNext**, we’ve seen too many people get scammed — so we built something better. We're here to help you buy smart and stress-free, with tested devices, local support, and peace-of-mind warranties.
